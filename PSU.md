# UNFINISHED WORK IN PROGRESS

**WARNING! This device operates with high voltage. This is life-threateningly dangerous! This is a documentation. Not a manual. If you try to build a similar device, the entire risk is yours alone! If you do not feel 100% safe in handling high voltage, do not do it and buy a safe, industrially manufactured device.**

If you find mistakes or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate and send them my way.

# Circuit Diagram

I chose this circuit as a basis for my power supply: https://syntherjack.net/modular-synth-power-supply/

However, I have made a few small changes. So here is the diagram of exactly my PSU:



# Transformer

In order to make sure that both secondary windings are connected in the same order
I checked using my oscilloscope. I did not confirm it experimentally but I am sure
that the secondary windings must be connected in the right phase order. The following
screenshots show the two options of the phases and I chose the right option because
I am sure that this is the only correct way to do it. P
