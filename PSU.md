# UNFINISHED WORK IN PROGRESS

# Circuit Diagram

I chose this circuit as a basis for my power supply: https://syntherjack.net/modular-synth-power-supply/

However, I have made a few small changes. So here is the diagram of exactly my PSU:



# Transformer

In order to make sure that both secondary windings are connected in the same order

that the secondary windings must be connected in the right phase order. The following
screenshots show the two options of the phases and I chose the right option because
I am sure that this is the only correct way to do it. P
