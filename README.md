# Eurorack DIY

## Case

My first step was to measure the available space for my Eurorack: 76cm. Minus 2x 18mm for the vertical walls of the case I had space for 142HP (722mm).

Wood: Spruce, 18mm; horizontal: two pieces 722mm x 200mm and vertical: two pieces 310mm x 200mm (slightly higher than required for some "feets" on the left and on the right side)

I oiled the wood with Schrader Wood Oil (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09XFDVP6Z). This went really well, the oil has no smell at all, so I could do it comfortably in our living room.

I ordered four rails 142HP (722mm) from Modular Synth Lab (Haarlem/NL) incl. threaded strips (no loose nuts). The rails seem to comply with the common rail profile (19" Tr√§gerprofil) from Gie-Tec, which unfortunately can't be aligned with a flat surface because it will tilt. Therefore I designed small supporting elements and printed them with my 3D printer. Find them in the 3D models folder as file railsupports.stl
